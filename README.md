###### Tools/Technology
Microsoft Excel was used to understand the affect that goals and launch date have on the outcome of Kickstarter campaigns. Specifically, to determine the affect goals may have on the outcome of a Kickstarter campaign, the COUNTIFS function was used. To determine the affect launch date may have on the outcome of Kickstarter campaigns, a PivotChart was used.

###### Charts
The following section has two line charts. The first line chart depicts the outcome of Kickstarter campaigns based on the goal amount. The goal amounts were split into 12 groups per the instructions provided in the assignment. The second line chart depicts the outcome of Kickstarter camppaigns based on the launch date of the campaign.
